[main]
# Backup jobs, by name, which should be run Each job must have a corresponding 
# config section. Jobs can be named essentially anything but should not contain 
# any special characters.
jobs = backupMyStuff, backupWebsites, backupOurDB, backupOurSVN

# Loglevel maps directly to syslog levels, with appropriate values ranging
# from 0-7. Level 0 is the least verbose, where 7 wil log debug output.
loglevel = 5

# Fairly obvious. Make sure each of these values are correct for your system.
# The individual necessity of a given binary is determined by the type of
# backup job.
rsync_bin = /usr/bin/rsync
tar_bin = /bin/tar
gzip_bin = /bin/gzip
mysql_bin = /usr/bin/mysql
mysqldump_bin = /usr/bin/mysqldump
svnadmin_bin = /usr/bin/svnadmin

[defaults]
# Any parameter defined in this section can be overridden within 
# individual job stanzas.
rsync_opts = -a
tar_opts = -czpf
gzip_opts = -q
svnadmin_opts = -q

# Backup job stanzas; there can be any number of these.  Each "type" can 
# potentially have different parameter requirements.

# Destination paths (dst) can contain strftime() macros. Check out the strftime 
# man page for a list of available macros.  Source paths (src) can contain 
# globs and any number of directories/files.  Each path must be separated 
# with a comma.

# Valid types are tgz, rsync, mysql and svn:
#
#     tgz = Creates a gzipped tarball of the source files/dirs .
#           (requires: type, src, dst)
#
#   rsync = Mirrors a set of sources to a destination.
#           (requires: type, src, dst)
#
#   mysql = Produces a gzipped dump of mysql databases. 
#           (requires: type, databases, dst).
#
#     svn = Products a gzipped dump of a single SVN repository.
#           (requires: type, repo, dst).


# Example tgz backup job using globs and strftime macros.
[backupMyStuff]
type = tgz
src = /path/to/source, /path/to/source2 /path/to/stuff/*.foo
dst = /archives/version_control-%H.tar.gz


# Example rsync job.
[backupWebsites]
type = rsync
src = /home/www/www.mysite.com /var/log/mysite/*_log
dst = /archive/%Y/%m
rsync_opts = -aR


# Example mysql dump job. Some parameters operate differently here, see below.
[backupOurDB]
type = mysql

# Databases to dump. Any number can be specified, including the keyword "all".  
# As would be expected, specifying "all" will dump all databases within the 
# specified mysql instance.
databases = ourdb

# Destination operates a bit differently for mysql.  The reason is that we 
# support multiple databases, each with their own dump file.  As such, the 
# basename of the destination path is actually modified.
#
# For example, if a destination of /tmp/daily-db-backup.gz were specified, 
# the actual output file would be /tmp/ourdb-daily-db-backuip.gz.  Basically, 
# the database name is appended to the beginning of the output file.  This 
# behavior may be more configurable in the future.
dst = /archive/ourdb-%Y-%m-%d.gz

# Optional parameters for authenticating with mysql.  If no username or 
# password is required, the keyword "none" must be specified where applicable.
user = root
pass = passw0rd!!


# Example Subversion dump job.  In order for this to work, backinator must 
# be running on a system with file level access to the actual repository.  
# Subversion jobs are one-to-one, meaning you need a discrete job entry for 
# each repository.
[backupOurSVN]
type = svn
repo = /home/svn/oursvn
dst = /archive/oursvn-svn-%w.gz
